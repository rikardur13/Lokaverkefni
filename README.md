There are onboard header outputs for I2C, SPI and Serial (USART). 
This is intended for remote communication or datalogging.

The software is written in C using Atmel Software Framework <a href="http://www.atmel.com/tools/avrsoftwareframework.aspx"></a>.
To tune the engine is Tunerstudio used, with modified configuration file from Speeduino <a href="http://speeduino.com/wiki/index.php/Speeduino"></a>.
